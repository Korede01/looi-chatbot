# NLTK Utilities

The `nltk_utils.py` script provides utility functions for text preprocessing using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. This README explains the purpose of this file, the thought process behind it, its usage, the packages utilized, and the functions involved, along with customization options.

## Purpose

The purpose of `nltk_utils.py` is to preprocess text data before feeding it into the neural network model for training or inference. Text preprocessing involves tokenization, stemming, and creating a bag of words representation, which is essential for training machine learning models, particularly for text classification tasks.

## Thought Process

- **NLTK Integration**: The script leverages the NLTK library, a popular tool for natural language processing tasks, for tokenization and stemming.
- **Text Normalization**: Tokenization breaks down sentences into individual words or tokens, while stemming reduces words to their root forms to handle variations.
- **Bag of Words**: The bag of words representation converts tokenized sentences into binary vectors, where each element represents the presence or absence of a word in the vocabulary.

## Usage

1. **Importing the Script**:
   - Import the `nltk_utils.py` script into the main training or inference script where text preprocessing is required.

2. **Tokenization**:
   - Use the `tokenize()` function to split sentences into arrays of words or tokens.

3. **Stemming**:
   - Apply the `stem()` function to find the root form of words, reducing them to their base forms.

4. **Bag of Words Representation**:
   - Utilize the `bag_of_words()` function to convert tokenized sentences into binary vectors, indicating the presence or absence of words in the vocabulary.

## Packages Used

- **numpy**: NumPy library for efficient array manipulation and numerical computations.
- **nltk**: Natural Language Toolkit for natural language processing tasks, including tokenization and stemming.

## Functions

- **tokenize(sentence)**: Splits sentences into arrays of words or tokens using NLTK's word tokenizer.
- **stem(word)**: Finds the root form of words using stemming with NLTK's Porter stemmer.
- **bag_of_words(tokenized_sentence, words)**: Converts tokenized sentences into binary vectors (bag of words representation) based on the presence of words in the vocabulary.

## Customization

- **Stemming Algorithm**: Explore different stemming algorithms or libraries for word normalization, such as Snowball stemmer or Lancaster stemmer.
- **Tokenization Rules**: Customize tokenization rules to handle specific cases or languages.
- **Vocabulary Expansion**: Extend the vocabulary by incorporating domain-specific or additional words relevant to the task at hand.
